# Chalk talk 101

Typically, in academic settings, faculty candidates give chalk talks to outline their future work in terms of the first big ideas that will go into their initial grant proposals (e.g., ~5Y federal grants). While seminars summarize their past work and experience, chalk talks are all about what's next and how this is the right place/environment to bring these big ideas to fruition!

## Background
-	Chalk Talk. You do not need to use chalk. Expect this to be much more interactive than the seminar. Many candidates use slides, but the flow is sometimes less linear and has more hopping around between slides. Other candidates have used alternative presentation platforms, including physical and virtual whiteboards. 
-	Think of a chalk talk as an opportunity to articulate your scientific 5 to 10-year plan. It is best to start with some background, including the current knowledge in your field and gaps you would like to address. Next, you should articulate your immediate and long-term goals and the overarching hypothesis you want to pursue to address your goals. Because this is part of an interview process, you would like to let us know how the infrastructure and collaborators at the University of Colorado AMC could support you in achieving your long- and short-term goals. The fun part of a chalk talk is the conversations that happen in between. The more straightforward the articulation of your scientific approach, the more interactive the chalk talk will be with local experts.  
-	The outline below gives a general format for successfully structuring a chalk talk; there can be some flexibility if you prefer. This is your time. At the end of the chalk talk, the people participating in this session with you should have a clear idea of your background, your goals, the tools that you will be bringing to the research question, the collaborations essential for your success, and the resources you will require to achieve your goals. 
- Goal: Have the audience understand how your unique positioning and CU’s capabilities will lead to an impactful, sustainable research program here 
- Duration: 75-90 minutes. There are often lots of questions. Usually, a planned set of 30-40 mins of remarks will fill the allotted time.

## Format
- **Recap**
  - In case there's a fraction of your audience that missed your seminar, start by recapping what you've accomplished so far and how this sets you up naturally for the proposed work.
- **Introduction**
  -	Background: Please start with ~5 mins of what positions you for success here. This is essentially a light overview of the most important seminar content, as some folks attending the chalk talk might not have been able to attend the seminar. 
  -	Vision: What is your overall scientific vision? What difference do you want to make in the world in 10 years? 
  -	Support: What funding agencies, organizations, etc., support work in the area? 
  -	Positioning: Who are the other key folks in this space, and how do you differentiate your work from them? 
- **Body**
  -	This portion is often best approached as an NIH research plan. We recommend discussing the components of an NIH grant, starting with the specific aims. 
  -	If this is your first faculty position, we strongly recommend that you start with what the aims of your first proposal will be and how they represent a step towards that overall vision. 
  -	Significance: Why does the work matter? 
  -	Innovation: How does the work shift the status quo? 
  -	Approach: How will you accomplish the aims? 
  -	Resources: What do you need to be successful in this work? What will you spend money on?
