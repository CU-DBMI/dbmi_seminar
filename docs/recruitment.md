# Candidate recruitment
## Pre-Interview Meeting (OPTIONAL | 30 mins, 2-4 weeks ahead of interview)
Candidates selected for a 1st interview can have a 30-minute meeting with the Search Chair or Director roughly 1-2 weeks in advance of the interview. During that meeting:
-	The Search Chair or Director provides an overview of DBMI and its mission
-	The Search Chair or Director describes the phase 1 (virtual) interview process
  -	For seminar and chalk talk guidelines, answer questions about the format of each component.

## 1st Interview outline
###	“Day 1”
-	One-on-one meetings with future colleagues, relevant Department and Campus leadership, and other partners (30 minutes each)
-	**Seminar.** 45 mins + 15 for questions (retrospective - what impactful research positions you for success)
  -	Be sure to include some discussion of prospective material and the next steps in your research  both to contextualize your work and because some attendees may not be able to make the chalk talk)

###	“Day 2”
-	[**Chalk Talk**](https://github.com/jananiravi/dbmi_seminar/blob/main/docs/chalk-talk.md). You do not need to use chalk. This name comes from pre-internet times when candidates were expected to use a chalkboard or whiteboard to map out their research journey. The chalk talks will help us evaluate your professional maturity and prospects for acquiring funding. (We use chalk talks internally, too, throughout the year, to help our faculty walk through proposed funding applications and novel research approaches.)
  -	Expect this to be much more interactive than your seminar –  more like a conversation about your future research plans, necessary data, possible collaborations, etc. You may use slides, but be aware the flow of the talk is less linear and might have you hopping around between slides. Other candidates have used alternative presentation platforms.
-	Goal: Have the audience understand how your unique positioning, coupled with DBMI and CU’s capabilities, will lead to an impactful, sustainable research program.
-	Duration: 75-90 minutes. There are often lots of questions. Usually, a planned set of 30-40 minutes of remarks will fill the allotted time
  -	Introduction:
    -	Background: Please start with ~5 mins of what positions you for success in DBMI. This should include a light overview of the most important parts of your seminar content, as some folks attending the chalk talk might not have been able to attend the seminar.
    -	Vision: What is your overall scientific vision? What difference do you want to make in the world in 10 years?
    -	Support: What funding agencies, organizations, etc., are supporting work in your area? What near-term funding applications will set you up for success, and what data do you need to be competitive?
  -	Positioning: Who are the other key folks in this space, and how do you differentiate your work from theirs?
  -	Body:
    -	This portion is often best approached as if describing an NIH research plan. If this is your first faculty position, we strongly recommend that you start with what the Specific Aims of your first proposal will be and how they represent a step towards that overall vision.
    -	Significance: Why does the work matter?
    -	Innovation: How does the work shift the status quo?
    -	Approach: How will you accomplish the aims?
    -	Resources: What do you need to be successful in this work? What will you spend money on?
-	Additional one-on-one meetings with departmental faculty and selected folks from other units as above.
